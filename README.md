Simple Apex Legends Cache Downloader/Merger Script
-------------------------------------------

To use this script follow the instruction below:

1: Move the "ApexCacheLauncher" script into the same folder as your
"r5apex.dxvk-cache" file, which will be the location similar to
"/path/to/steamapps/shadercache/1172470/DXVK\_state\_cache/r5apex.dxvk-cache"

2: In Steam, add this script as a non-steam game via the "Games" tab in
steam. Again, this will be in the directory of your "r5apex.dxvk-cache"
file, which will be the location similar to
"/path/to/steamapps/shadercache/1172470/DXVK\_state\_cache/r5apex.dxvk-cache"

3: You're done. Use this added script to launch Apex Legends each time
you play and it will always have the latest version of the
"r5apex.dxvk-cache" file.

4: Doctor up the non-steam script by downloading and adding an Apex
Legends icon to it, and changing to a more appealing name via the Steam
Game "Properties" menu.
