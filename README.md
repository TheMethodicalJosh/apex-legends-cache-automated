Simple Apex Legends Cache Downloader / Merger Script
---
**To use this script, follow the instruction below:**

 **1.** Download the script as a [ZIP](https://github.com/TheMethodicalJosh/apex-legends-cache-automated/releases) and extract it into the folder of your choice or clone the repository.

 **2.** Make sure to set the script as executable. `chmod +x ApexCacheLauncher`

 **3.** Execute the script. `./ApexCacheLauncher`

 **4.** The script will suggest a directory to move the script to. **You may do this manually as long as it is installed in the `DXVK_state_cache` directory.**

  **5.** Once the script moves itself, it will tell you again the directory you need. Add the script as a non-steam game using the final directory it gives you.

 **6.** You now launch from this script each time you play to keep your cache file updated. Spice up the look of your non-steam game if you'd like. Add a logo, or a banner, change the name in steam. Happy hunting!
